# The Wild Oasis

This project was built while following Jonas Schmedtmann’s React course.
After completing the course, I extended the application with additional features, including:

Create Guest – add new guests through a custom form

Create Booking – create bookings linked to existing guests and rooms

The goal of these additions was to make the app more complete and closer to a real hotel management workflow.
